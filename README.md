# Garrett's Boilerplate

#### My personal boilerplate for web apps 

There are many ways to structure a React project. This one works pretty well for me and enforces good separation of concerns,
has basic support for testing, and allows for adding in any kind of common database if and when a project calls for it. 

#### Included technologies

* React
* Node/Express
* Babel
* Webpack
* Prettier/ESLint (using the AirBnb style guide)
